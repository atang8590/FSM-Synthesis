Design Guidelines are to be followed not strictly
Just kidding

This whole thing is about sysnthesis.
You are given some state diagram.
This state diagram describes the funtional operation of the the design to be implemented.

The bottom line of everything is obtaining 
the implementation table and 
output table so as to get get your design at your doorstep.


SO the steps are 

1. Make your state table from the given drawn State Diagram 

2. From your state table, obtain the implementation table
the above step depends widely on the flip flop kind you wanna use for your design and
the various input signals you are working with.

3. Will continue another time
